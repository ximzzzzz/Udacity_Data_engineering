# Lesson 4 SPARK



## Numbers everyone should know

- ## GENERAL

### 	CPU : THE BRAIN OF YOUR COMPUTER 

​	CPU operation : 0.4 ns (fastest)

### 	MEMORY : place to store data before it goes to your cpu, 

### 						your computer's scratch paper(스케치북) for helping with more complicated calculations

​		MEMORY REFERENCE : 100 ns (second)

### 	STORAGE : THE FILE CABINET FOR DATA

​		RANDOM READ FROM SSD : 16 mu second

### 	NETWORK : ACCESS TO OUTSIDE WORLD 

​		ROUND TRIP FOR DATA FROM EU TO US : 150 ms



- ## CPU

  The CPU can also store small amounts of data inside itself in what are called **registers**. These registers hold data that the CPU is working with at the moment.

  The registers make computations more efficient: the registers avoid having to send data unnecessarily back and forth between memory (RAM) and the CPU.

  2.5 GHz CPU means it can handle 2.5 billion(십억) operations per second.

  and in lecture, it assumes for each operation, the cpu processes 8 byes of data. 

  so they can assume cpu processes 20 billion bytes per second
