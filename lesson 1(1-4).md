# lesson 1 : introduction to Data Modeling



## What is Data Modeling?

> " ... an abstraction that **organizes elements of data** and **how they will relate** to each other"
>
> Data modeling can easily translate to database modeling, as this is the essential **end state**





## Data Modeling

- Process to support business and user applications

- Gather Requirements

- Conceptual Data Modeling

  ​	just conceptual, draw by any tools. 

- Logical Data Modeling 

  ​	from conceptual to **logical**, using the concept of tables, schemas and columns

  ​	move boxes and arrows drew on conceptual stage to tables with columns

- Physical Data Modeling

  ​	transforming the logical data to databases, data definition language(DDL)

## 

## Why Data modeling is important?

- Organized data determines later data use

  ​	queries that could have been straightforward and simple might become complicated queries if data modeling is 

  ​	not well thought out

- begin prior to building out application, business logic and analytical models
