# Optimizing Table Design



- When a table is partitoned up into many pieces and distributed across slices in different machines, 

  this is done blindly

- if one has an idea about the frequent access pattern of a table, one can choose a more clever strategy

- The 2 possible strategies are:

  1. Distribution Style
     - EVEN 
     - Shuffling
     - 

  2. Sorting key
