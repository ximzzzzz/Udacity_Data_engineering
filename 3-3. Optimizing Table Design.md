# Optimizing Table Design



- When a table is partitoned up into many pieces and distributed across slices in different machines, 

  this is done blindly

- if one has an idea about the frequent access pattern of a table, one can choose a more clever strategy

- The 2 possible strategies are:

  1. Distribution Style
     - EVEN : balanced partitioning 

     - Shuffling(High cost of join with 'EVEN' distribution)

     - ALL : small tables could be replicated on all slices to speed up joins, 

       ​		used frequently for dimension tables

       ​		AKA 'broadcasting'

     - AUTO : leave a decision to Redshift,

       ​			small enough tables are distributed with an 'ALL' strategy

       ​			Large tables are distributed with 'EVEN' strategy

     - KEY : rows having similar values are placed in the same slice

       ​		this can lead to a skwed distribution if some values of the dist key are more frequent than others

       ​		however, very useful when a dimension table is too big to be distritubed with 'ALL' strategy.

       ​		in that case, we distribute both a fact table and a dimension table using the same dist key

       ​		if two tables are distributed on the joining keys, redshift collocates the rows from both tables on the 		same slices

  2. Sorting key
  
     - sort by one column which is frequently used
